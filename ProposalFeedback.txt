Project Proposal Feedback
Project: BookShelf
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
   Verbal Description:
      Your overview clearly explains what BookShelf is, what users can do
      (track books, discover, socialize, review), and the concept of a
      community-built database.  This meets the requirement well.  You
      compare BookShelf to two other applications, explaining what each
      platform lacks and what your project provides instead.  This also
      satisfies the requirement.  You also list a rich feature set and
      your hardware & software requirements and end user descriptions are
      complete.

   Justification:
      Here you mention what topics from you've learned are involved, and how
      they are extended as well.  Your proposed challenges, search
      optimization, recommendation system, analytics generation, amd social
      features, are significant but not impossible within one semester.
      This is especially true since you provide a good timeline.


Proposal Presentation [Slides and video] [3 points]:
   Slides:
      The slides are really nice!  The backgrounds are very eye-catching,
      and the white-on-black scheme is striking.  As a suggestion, you may
      want to make the text a bit larger ~ you have about the right amount
      of text for each of the things you describe, but it's kind of small.
      There is a lot of extra space on several of the slides that you could
      make use of.

Summary:
--------

Nice job overall!  Keep up the good work.  Will update after video is posted.
