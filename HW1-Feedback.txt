SPECIFIC COMMENTS:

Problem 1.1 ~ correct

Problem 1.2 ~ correct

Problem 2.4 ~ correct

Problem 2.5 ~ correct

Problem 4.2 ~ the submission doesn’t show a full CPM working (network,
   ES/EF/LS/LF, slack) to justify the numbers.

Problem 4.4 ~ correct

Problem 4.6 ~ correct

Problem 4.8 ~ The two “biggest mistakes” listed are not tracking at all
   and micromanaging.  The text typically emphasizes adding people to a late
   task (Brooks’s Law) and ignoring lost time assuming you can make it up
   later; the answer doesn’t align with these

Problem 5.1 ~ correct

Problem 5.3 ~ (e) “schedule at any time”, (h) sequential execution, and
(i) wait until finish are functional behaviors (not nonfunctional), and many
items should be labeled as user + functional rather than only “user.”

Problem 5.9 ~ correct


nice work!
